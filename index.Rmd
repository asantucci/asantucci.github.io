# Summary
I am a computational statistician, with background in causal inference and machine learning. I pride myself of writing unit-tested and well-documented code that yields reproducible results in a performant manner. 
Currently, I practice Data Science at [Cardinal Analytx Solutions](http://www.cardinalanalytx.com/) and also Lecture a sequence of graduate level scientific-computing courses at Stanford University.
