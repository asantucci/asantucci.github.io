# Summary
I am a computational statistician, with a background in causal inference and machine learning. 
I pride myself on writing unit-tested and well-documented code that yields reproducible results in a performant manner. 
Currently, I practice Data Science at [Airbnb](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/tagged/data-science) and also Lecture a sequence of graduate level scientific-computing courses at Stanford University.
