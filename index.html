<p>I am a computational statistician, with a background in causal
inference and machine learning. Currently, I develop Generative AI
software at <a
href="http://www.unofficialgoogledatascience.com/">Google</a>.
Previously, I also Lectured a sequence of graduate level
scientific-computing courses at Stanford University.
With my unique blend of academic, teaching, and industry experience, I aspire to contribute to the 
academic community by publishing innovative work and mentoring the next generation of researchers.

<h3>Undergraduate (2012)</h3>
<p>My research journey began with my B.A. thesis in Economics at U.C. Berkeley, advised by <a href="https://econ.washington.edu/people/gregory-m-duncan">Gregory Duncan</a>, where I came up with a quasi-experiment framework 
to answer the question, “what’s the causal effect of sports participation on GPA’s?” (<a href="https://econ.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Santucci.pdf">thesis writing sample</a>). This was a practical question of 
interest to me as a student athlete. I used STATA to analyze Average Treatment Effects, 
and the quasi-experiment involved looking toward student-athletes who either walked onto the team midway 
through their collegiate career, or who got injured midway through their collegiate sports career and then were forced to no longer play sport 
(*in either case, we get to observe the scholastic performance for the same individual, partitioned by participation in sport). 
I found that football players with low incoming SAT scores were likely to have their grades increased by 0.8 grade points as a function of being a student-athlete, 
whereas for women’s crew the effect was reversed: participating in sports decreased their GPA’s by almost 1/2 a grade point. 
The intuition here is partly a regression to the (global) mean, but also can be explained by minimum grade requirements for being eligible to compete at the NCAA level, 
and access to tutors. Being able to answer a meaningful and practically significant question of interest is what got me hooked on research.
</p>

<div id="graduate" class="section level3">
<h3>Econ Consulting (2012-'14)</h3>
<p>
For several years after graduation, I worked with <a href="https://econ.berkeley.edu/profile/daniel-l-mcfadden">Daniel McFadden</a>, 
Nobel laureate and founder of the logistic regression model, 
on estimating causal damages from the 2010 Gulf Oil Spill. 
In particular, I was the core contributor for procuring R code to support Dan’s expert testimony on how the spill affected tourism in the Gulf. 
We constructed a discrete choice model to infer the value of lost visitation to the Gulf, based in part on proprietary survey data. 
A national level survey with data from over 26,000 households traveling to almost 40,000 unique destinations was collected 
in order to estimate the value of taking a trip to a particular location, conditional on demographic characteristics of the 
trip participants as well as destination specific features. I used Python to create two
giant “time” and “distance” travel cost matrices, each containing the cost, in minutes or miles, for
all combinations of travelers and trips in the survey.
From this, it was possible to estimate e.g. what the cost of driving and flying was per mile of travel. 
When we put together travel costs with lost visitation from beach surveys, we were able to come up with a bottom-line number for the impact of the 
spill on visitation and the financial implications to surrounding counties. I used ArcGIS to map out the fiscal impacts as a function of 
geographic location across all 3,000+ counties in the US.
</p>
<h3>Graduate (2014-'17)</h3>
<p>
At Stanford, I earned an M.S. in Computational Mathematics (GPA 3.96). 
After earning an A+ in a project-based Distributed Algorithms course, 
I worked with Professor <a href="https://stanford.edu/~rezab/">Reza Zadeh</a> on a distributed min-cut algorithm for the remainder of the summer. 
Although we didn’t publish, it was an excellent exercise in research (<a href="files/rd.pdf">draft paper</a>). I was also afforded a research internship
at Lawrence Livermore National Lab, where I worked with Kaiser Research on Sepsis prognosis using machine learned models and bayesian methods (<a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/epdf/10.1164/ajrccm-conference.2016.193.1_MeetingAbstracts.A2714?role=tab">example publication</a>).
</p>
<p>
For my M.S. thesis, I worked under the supervision of esteemed economist <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/guido-w-imbens">Guido Imbens</a> (now Nobel Laureate). 
My work applied causal inference with machine learning toward sports analytics, receiving an A+ for its creativity and rigor. 
Specifically, we analyzed bookmaker’s odds of meeting the spread, i.e. the expected score differential between two teams, and used this as a conditioner 
on which we could observe unanticipated effects (<a href="files/meet_the_spread.pdf">rationale</a>). We measured the nightlife index within a city using Bureau of Labor Statistics census data 
on the number of musical recording studios and entertainment clubs within the locale (<a href="files/Party_by_Team_Location.pdf">distribution of nightlife</a>). 
We then filtered our attention to cases where games are played back-to-back within 24 hours of each other; to the
extent that next-day opponent is uncorrelated with exposure to treatment, we have identification in our variable of interest (<a href="files/next_day_opponent_mlb.pdf">heatmap</a>).
Teams visiting cities with higher nightlife indices consistently underperformed against bookmaker expectations, revealing a novel pattern in sports analytics. 
We replicate our analysis and find consistent results in two different sports: NBA and MLB.
As a robustness check, we also verify that the hangover effect dissipates when players rest more than 24 hours after visiting a city with an active nightlife index.
This yielded a profitable betting strategy that I pursued for the summer after graduation (<a href="files/causal_hangover_effect (1).pdf">writing excerpt</a>).

<div id="lecturing" class="section level3">
<h3>Lecturing</h3>
<p>
After graduating, I was asked by the Director of <a href="https://icme.stanford.edu/">ICME</a>, <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/margot-gerritsen">Margot Gerritsen</a>, to serve as a Lecturer for my alma mater; 
for the next seven years, in addition to my full time role(s) within industry, 
I concurrently taught graduate courses in Python and C++ to nearly 200 students annually. 
I managed a staff of at least 4 TA’s each quarter, and I was awarded “Best Lecturer” 3 separate years, 
as determined by students and fellow faculty. I also led programming workshops and interview preparation sessions, 
honing my ability to distill complex ideas and fostering a passion for teaching that I hope to continue in a faculty role after completing my PhD. 
I’m confident that skills I garnered as a lecturer will be useful in describing my research in front of large audiences.</p>
<div id="google-research" class="section level3">
<h3>Google Research (2018-'24)</h3>
<p>
At Google, I have worked on transformative projects at the intersection of machine learning and product innovation. 
At YouTube, I developed recommendation algorithms that transitioned from heuristic to machine-learned strategies, contributing 
significantly as a founding engineer on YouTube Shorts. Concretely, while we started with a deterministic triggering and ranking strategy 
(i.e. always placing the Shorts “shelf” in the same position within the feed for all users), over the course of several years I developed and iteratively refined 
a reward model to capture how much value the Shelf delivers on a per-user basis, and then created a probabilistic model to show the shelf with a 
probability that is proportional to the estimated long(er) term value. My foundations in distributed algorithms allowed me to personally implement my 
own ideas into production using C++.
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11805v4">Gemini 1.5
Technical Report</a> captured the attention of the scientific community (garnering over 2,000 citations in the past year). 
As part of the core team, I created a “self-critique” framework for LLM evaluation that was consistent with human raters, and was recognized on the 1.5 technical report accordingly.
The mechanism for evaluation was a side-by-side framework comparing two different model responses to a given prompt.
The most effective way to obtain reliable and interpretable results was to embed explicit rubrics within the instruction set
to the agent. Using few-shot learning, we were able to engineer a machine-learned rater with inter-rater reliability
that was at least as good as the average human-rater.
After creating a satisfactory evaluation framework, I then became interested with combining the results from
human-raters, comprising ground truth labels, with predictions for model quality from the agent in a way that sensibly
augments our evaluation dataset.
Specifically, I proposed using <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-32/issue-2/Model-Assisted-Survey-Estimation-with-Modern-Prediction-Techniques/10.1214/16-STS589.pdf">Model Assisted Estimation</a> within the LLM self-critique framework: this allows us to refine
a model based estimate with an offset factor that captures the expected bias, yielding an overall unbiased estimator with
reduced variance. In other words, instead of using just an LLM score for model quality, or alternatively just using a human rater based score,
I came up with a way to combine the two sets of data meaningfully and in a statistically rigorous way.
</p>
<p>
Most recently, my work in Generative AI has focused on media algorithms and spatial Super Resolution.
In order to tackle a new domain, I started with a literature review focusing on seminal papers such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Attention is All You Need</a>, 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929">Vision Transformer</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15691">Video Vision Transformer</a>. 
Additionally, I found <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239">Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models</a> to be quite relevant.
I then personally implemented a Diffusion Transformer for video enhancement, i.e. 
a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07648">Content-Aware Degradation-Driven Transformer</a> (inspired by the latest research). As the sole author of the
prototype algorithm, I acquired significant experience architecting neural networks using <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/">JAX</a> primitives.

<div id="future-directions" class="section level3">
<h3>Future Directions</h3>
With a strong background in fundamental tools like (causal) regression, rigorous training in
computational and mathematical engineering, and more recent work with LLM's and computer vision techniques,
my diverse background is well-suited toward research in foundation modeling. I believe that some of the most exciting
research is ripe for fruition, specifically at the intersection of robotics and foundation models; the intuitive reason is
that robotic agency becomes both practical and extremely useful once we have foundation models which can be queried with natural language and
images. I believe that a collaboration with professors like <a href="https://ai.stanford.edu/~cbfinn/">Chelsea Finn</a> and
<a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/">Trevor Darrell</a> would be immensely valuable and impactful; both individuals have excellent
knowledge on foundation models, and additionally robotics.
