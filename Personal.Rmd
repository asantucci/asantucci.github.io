### Personal Life
I have been overjoyed these past couple years by my rescue dog, Bean!

### Athletics
In my youth, I practiced Gymnastics. Here's [a video of me competing at a national competition in Las Vegas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qg4V50X7QQ&t); incidentally, I was part of Stanford's team at the time.

In college, I walked-on to Cal's Swimming and Diving team. Here's [one of my dives from my last home-meet in 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWGe3ETIur4). Training 30+ hours a week got me wondering: what's the effect on my academic performance? With this, I set out to write my senior thesis exploring [causal effects of NCAA D1 sports participation on GPA's](http://econ.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Santucci.pdf). Obtaining an answer to a question that mattered to me, I got hooked on statistics.

These days, I stay active via [Skiing](https://youtu.be/7vT_NMC-W1w?t=1200) and [Mountain Biking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJvCjN2P1lc&ab_channel=AndreasSantucci).
