# Why I Teach
I love to share my passion(s) with others. Education has been a cornerstone of my life and I strongly 
believe in giving back to the community. What's better than having a lightbulb moment after spending hours
thinking through a problem? Being able to create that same illumination within another student with 
a concise explanation.

# Sample Materials
I recently put together a few notes on an [Introduction to R Programming](files/Introduction_to_R_ICME_Short_Course_2018.pdf) for a one-day short course.
Here's an example of some [distributed algorithms notes](files/cme323_lec5.pdf) I created for a course 
I helped teach. I enjoy consolidating information into concise and digestable notes. For example, here's a course summary from my [first statistical inference course](files/stats_200_cs.pdf).
