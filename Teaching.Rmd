### Why I Teach
I love to share my passion(s) with others. Education has been a cornerstone of my life and I strongly 
believe in giving back to the community. What's better than having a lightbulb moment after spending hours
thinking through a problem? Being able to create that same illumination within another student with 
a concise explanation.

### Experience
A listing of some of my past teaching experiences.
  
  - Teaching Assistant (CME 106, CME 323)
  
  - Teaching Fellow (CME 211, CME 305, CME 323)
  
  - [Summer Workshops](https://icme.stanford.edu/events/icme-summer-workshops) (Intro to R '16, '17, '18, and Intro to Stats '17)

### Sample Materials
I enjoy consolidating information into concise and digestable notes. For example, here's a course summary from my 
[first statistical inference course](files/stats_200_cs.pdf). Some more examples:

  - I recently put together a few notes on an [Introduction to R Programming](files/intro_r.pdf) for a one-day short course.

  - Here's an example of some [distributed algorithms notes](files/cme323_lec5.pdf) I created for a course I helped teach.
